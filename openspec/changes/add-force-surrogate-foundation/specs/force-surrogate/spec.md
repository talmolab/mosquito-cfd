## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Single-source force normalization

The force-surrogate module SHALL be the single, parameterized source for aerodynamic force
normalization and force-coefficient computation. The reference normalization SHALL be a pure
function of its kinematic and geometric inputs (no hardcoded amplitude/frequency, no I/O) and
SHALL reproduce the validated reference values. No other module SHALL re-derive `F_ref` inline.

#### Scenario: Reference normalization at the validated point

- **Given** `f_star = 1.0`, `phi_amp_deg = 70.0`, `r_tip = 3.0`, `span = 3.0`, `chord = 1.0`, `rho = 1.0`
- **When** `compute_force_reference` is called
- **Then** it returns `u_tip_max ≈ 23.029`, `q_tip ≈ 265.17`, `area ≈ 2.3562`, `f_ref ≈ 624.79` (each within 0.1%; these are recomputed from the formula and consistent with the rounded values in `examples/flapping_wing/RESULTS.md`)

#### Scenario: Parameterization, not hardcoded

- **Given** the validated inputs with `phi_amp_deg` reduced from 70° to 35°
- **When** `compute_force_reference` is called
- **Then** both `u_tip_max` and `f_ref` are strictly smaller than at 70°
- **And** doubling `f_star` doubles `u_tip_max`

#### Scenario: Force coefficients

- **Given** force component arrays `Fx, Fy, Fz` and a nonzero reference `F_ref`
- **When** `compute_force_coefficients` is called
- **Then** it returns `cf_x = Fx / F_ref`, `cf_y = Fy / F_ref`, `cf_z = Fz / F_ref` element-wise, preserving input shape (scalar input → scalar output)

#### Scenario: Zero reference rejected

- **Given** `F_ref = 0.0` (reachable when `f_star = 0` or `phi_amp_deg = 0`)
- **When** `compute_force_coefficients` is called
- **Then** it raises `ValueError` rather than returning inf/NaN coefficients

#### Scenario: Empty and NaN forces

- **Given** an empty force array, or a force array containing NaN, with a nonzero `F_ref`
- **When** `compute_force_coefficients` is called
- **Then** an empty input yields empty outputs without error, and a NaN force propagates to a NaN coefficient (no exception)

#### Scenario: Inline normalization is replaced by the shared helper

- **Given** the flapping-wing figure script `examples/flapping_wing/generate_all_figures.py`
- **When** it computes the force reference
- **Then** it calls `compute_force_reference` from this module rather than re-deriving `F_ref` inline, and still reports `f_ref ≈ 624.79`

### Requirement: Dimensionless units sidecar

The force-surrogate module SHALL emit and parse a `units.json` sidecar declaring the unit of every
data column, validated **on both write and read** against a documented dimensionless units
vocabulary (dimensionless coefficients/forces, angles in degrees, dimensionless frequency/time).
The pipeline is dimensionless by design; `openspec/project.md` is silent on a units convention, so
this establishes one for surrogate data (a physical SI mapping, if ever needed, is a downstream
concern).

#### Scenario: Units sidecar round-trip

- **Given** a units mapping over surrogate columns (e.g. `{"cf_x": "dimensionless", "stroke_amp": "deg", "frequency": "dimensionless (f*)"}`)
- **When** it is written with `write_units_sidecar` and read back with `read_units_sidecar`
- **Then** the parsed mapping equals the original, and the file is UTF-8 JSON

#### Scenario: Unknown unit rejected on write

- **Given** a units mapping with a column unit not in the vocabulary (e.g. `{"force": "newtons"}`)
- **When** `write_units_sidecar` is called
- **Then** it raises `ValueError` naming the offending column and unit

#### Scenario: Invalid sidecar rejected on read

- **Given** a `units.json` on disk that is malformed (not a JSON object) or carries a unit outside the vocabulary
- **When** `read_units_sidecar` is called
- **Then** it raises `ValueError` (read enforces the same vocabulary as write)

### Requirement: Run provenance with caller-supplied timestamp and container digest

The force-surrogate module SHALL capture run provenance by reusing the existing benchmarks metadata
capture, and SHALL (a) require the Docker image **digest** (not merely a tag) and (b) accept a
**caller-supplied timestamp** so artifacts are reproducible rather than stamped with wall-clock
time at runtime (CC-1).

#### Scenario: Run provenance includes container digest

- **Given** a Docker image digest, an existing inputs file, and a caller-supplied ISO timestamp
- **When** `capture_surrogate_run_metadata` is called
- **Then** the returned metadata records the git commit, the supplied image digest (under `docker_image`), and the inputs hash

#### Scenario: Caller-supplied timestamp recorded

- **Given** a caller-supplied ISO-8601 timestamp string
- **When** `capture_surrogate_run_metadata` is called
- **Then** the returned metadata's `timestamp` equals the supplied value verbatim (an ISO-8601 string), not the runtime wall clock

#### Scenario: Missing digest rejected

- **Given** an empty or missing Docker image digest
- **When** `capture_surrogate_run_metadata` is called
- **Then** it raises `ValueError` rather than recording provenance without a pinned image

### Requirement: Cluster-free test fixtures

The repository SHALL provide committed synthetic fixtures that allow force-surrogate tests to run
without the RunAI cluster, a GPU, or AMReX plotfiles.

#### Scenario: Synthetic fixture is usable cluster-free

- **Given** the committed `tests/fixtures/synthetic_ib_particle.csv`
- **When** it is loaded in a test with no cluster/GPU available
- **Then** it parses (name-based, not positional), mirrors the real IB-particle schema in column order (`iStep,time,X,Y,Z,Vx,Vy,Vz,Rx,Ry,Rz,Fx,Fy,Fz,Mx,My,Mz,Fcp{x,y,z},Tcp{x,y,z},SumU{x,y,z},SumT{x,y,z}` — `Fx,Fy,Fz` at their real positions), and its forces yield the exact known coefficients when normalized by the fixture's round reference `F_ref`
